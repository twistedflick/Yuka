/* Threading note: unless otherwise noted, it is unsafe to invoke multiple
 * method calls on a single given instance of any of these classes across
 * multiple threads simultaneously, without using some kind of external
 * barrier (such as a POSIX mutex or a spinlock).
 *
 * However, it is perfectly safe to use them in multiple threads so long
 * as no single object is being accessed by two threads at the same time.
 * Particular care must be taken with scenes and the objects within them -
 * if one thread is touching part of a scene, you can't assume it's safe
 * to modify a different part of the scene at the same time in a different
 * thread. In contrast, if you have two threads which are each manipulating
 * independent scenes, then no concurrency issues will arise.
 *
 * This is unquestionably a limitation of the implementation, but it's a
 * limitation which can be removed in future by adding and using locking
 * primitives in certain parts of the code without requiring significant
 * reorganisation.
